The internship course is one of the most important courses in the program. In order to graduate, you must complete either the internship course or the Capstone course. Most people choose to do an internship, because it provides the opportunity to get some real-world work experience, and to get paid for it. Internships are typically taken during 3rd or 4th year. 

To get started planning for your internship, head over to the [Student Life Portal](https://studentlifeportal.ontariotechu.ca/home.htm). Once you're signed in, head to the Co-Op & Internship section.
