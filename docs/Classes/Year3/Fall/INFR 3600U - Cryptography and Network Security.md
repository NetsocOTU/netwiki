## Study Resources
- [The Code Book](https://simonsingh.net/books/the-code-book/) by Simon Singh; entertaining educational book about the history of cryptography, covering everything from the early ancient methods to modern algorithms like PGP. 
- [Cryptohack.org](https://cryptohack.org/) - "A free, fun platform for learning modern cryptography." Similar to something like TryHackMe but focused entirely on cryptography and programming
