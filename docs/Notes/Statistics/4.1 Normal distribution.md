If a normal distribution has a mean of $\mu$ and a standard deviation of $\sigma$ then we can write the distribution as $N(\mu, \sigma)$.

The mean and standard deviation are called the **parameters** of the normal distribution. A normal distribution with a mean of 0 and standard deviation of 1 is called the **standard normal distribution.**

The above example uses a standardization technique called the **Z-score**. The Z-score is defined as the number of standard deviations that a case falls above or below the mean. If the observation is 1 standard deviation above the mean, then it has a Z-score of 1. If it is 1.5 standard deviations below the mean, it has a Z-score of -1.5. It is defined mathematically as $Z=(x-\mu)\div\sigma$.

The **percentile** of an observation is the fraction of observations with lower values. Using the above example, it is the fraction of people who scored less than Ann. If we graphed a curve of all test scores, it would be equal to the area under the curve, up to Annâ€™s score on the x-axis. This is generally calculated on a computer or graphing calculator.
