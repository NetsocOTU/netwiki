This chapter extends the methods of the previous chapter to apply confidence intervals and hypothesis tests to differences in population proportions: $p_1 - p_2$. 

# Sampling distribution of the difference of two proportions

> [!def] Conditions for the sampling distribution of the difference of two proportions to be normal
> $\hat{p_1} - \hat{p_2}$ can be modeled using a normal distribution when:
> - **Independence, extended**: The data are independent within and between the two groups. Generally satisfied if the data come from two independent random samples or if the data come from a randomized experiment. 
> - **Success-failure condition**: The success-failure condition holds for both groups (checked separately)
> When these conditions are satisfied, the standard error of $\hat{p_1} - \hat{p_2}$ is
> $SE = \sqrt{\frac{p_1(1-p_1)}{n_1} + \frac{p_2(1-p_2)}{n_2}}$
> where $p_1$ and $p_2$ represent the population proportions, and $n_1$ and $n_2$ represent the sample sizes.

We can apply the generic confidence interval formula for a difference of two proportions, using $\hat{p_1} - \hat{p_2}$ as the point estimate and substituting the SE formula:
$$\hat{p_1} - \hat{p_2} \pm z^* \times \sqrt{\frac{p_1(1-p_1)}{n_1} + \frac{p_2(1-p_2)}{n_2}}$$


# Hypothesis testing for a difference of proportions
**When the null hypothesis is that the proportions are equal** (i.e. this type of test *is not more effective* than the other), use the pooled proportion to verify the success-failure condition and estimate the standard error.
$\large \hat{p}_{pooled}=\frac{\text{number of successes}}{\text{number of cases}}=\frac{\hat{p}_1 n_1 + \hat{p}_2 n_2}{n_1+n_2}$


Are mammograms effective?

|           | Died | Lived |
| --------- | ---- | ----- |
| Mammogram | 500  | 44425 |
| Control   | 505  | 44405 | 

The null hypothesis here (that mammograms are not effective) is $p_1 - p_2 = 0$. We use a pooled proportion to check the success-failure condition:
$$\large \hat{p}_{pooled} = \frac{\text{total \# of patients who died}}{\text{total \# of patients in study}} = \frac{500+505}{500+44425+505+44405}=0.0112$$

This is an estimate of the breast cancer death rate across the entire study, and it's our best estimate of the proportions *if the null hypothesis is true*, that $p_1 = p_2$.

**Is it reasonable to model the difference in proportions using a normal distribution?**

Since all value are at least 10, the success-failure condition is satisfied.
