---
- **Sample space**: the set $S$ of all possible outcomes for a *random experiment* (an experiment where the outcome depends on random chance)
- An **event** is a set of outcomes
- If a sample space $S$ has $n$ outcomes with equal probability, then an event $E$ consisting of $m$ outcomes has probability $P(E)=\frac{m}{n}$


- **Canonical random experiment**
	- "A box contains $n$ distinct objects; $k$ objects are randomly selected from the box, one at a time."
	- Four variations:
		- Ordered with and without replacement (permutations)
		- Unordered with and without replacement (combination)
# Permutations
## Variation 1
- Ordered, no replacement
- Box has 3 objects numbered 1, 2, and 3. Pick objects one at a time. How many different outcomes are there?
	- $3! = 3\cdot 2 \cdot 1 = 6$
- Same experiment except the box has 5 objects. You only pick 3. How many outcomes are there?
	- $5 \cdot 4 \cdot 3 = 60$
- **The number of permutations of $n$ objects is** $n \cdot (n-1) \cdot \cdot \cdot 2 \cdot 1 = n!$
- **The number of $k$-permutations from a set of $n$ is**
$$\large P_{n,k}=\frac{n!}{(n-k)!}$$
## Variation 2
- Ordered, with replacement
- Same amount of choices each time
- **$k$-permutations of $n$ with replacement is $n^k$**

# Combinations
## Variation 3
- Unordered, without replacement
- Consider a box with objects 1, 2, 3, 4. How many ways are there to form groups of 3, if the order does not matter?
	- $\large \frac{4!}{3!}=\frac{24}{6}=4$
- **The number of distinct $k$-combinations or subsets of $k$ objects from a set of $n$ objects is**
$$ \large C_{n,k}=\frac{n!}{k!(n-k)!}$$

## Variation 4
- Unordered, with replacement
- A doughnut shop has 5 different kinds of donuts. How many unique ways are there to select 12 doughnuts?
$$\large C_{(n+k-1),k}=C_{(5+12-1),12}=C_{16,12}=1820$$
