# Paired Data
Two sets of observations are **paired** if each observation in one set has a special correspondence or connection with exactly one observation in the other data set.

To analyze paired data, it is often useful to look at the difference in outcomes of each pair of observations. 

# Inference for Paired Data
To analyze a paired data set, simply analyze the differences and use the same $t$-distribution techniques applied in [[7.1 One-sample means with the t-distribution|7.1]].
