> [!def] Null and Alternative Hypotheses
> The **null hypothesis** ($H_0$) often represents a skeptical perspective or a claim to be tested.
> The **alternative hypothesis** ($H_A$) represents an alternative claim under consideration and is often represented by a range of possible parameter values.

Just because we don't find supporting evidence for the null hypothesis doesn't mean that the alternative is true. Think about a court case: even if the jurors leave unconvinced of guilt beyond a reasonable doubt, this does not mean they believe the defendant is innocent. 

# Example
Question: How many of the world's 1 year old children have been vaccinated against some disease:
a. 20%
b. 50%
c. 80%

We ask this question to randomly selected people with a college degree and would like to determine if their guesses are as accurate as randomly guessing. That is, the proportion of people who pick the correct answer, is about 33.3%. This is our null hypothesis:
$H_0: p = 0.333$
$H_A: p \ne 0.333$

We want to make a conclusion about the *population parameter* $p$. The value we are comparing the parameter to is called the **null value** - in this case, 0.333.

We have sample data for 50 sampled adults. Of this group, 24% got the question correct. We want to know if this deviation from 33% is simply due to random chance, or if the data provides strong evidence that the population proportion is different from 33%. 

First, we need to check whether it is reasonable to construct a confidence interval for $p$ using the sample data. If so, we construct a 95% confidence interval. 

- Success-failure condition is passed
	- $\hat{p} = 0.24$
	- $n\hat{p} = 12$, $n(1-\hat{p})=38$
	- Trials are independent
- To construct the confidence interval, we need the point estimate (0.24), the critical value for the 95% confidence interval ($z^* = 1.96$), and the standard error of $\hat{p}$ which in this case is $0.060$. We can then construct the confidence interval:

We are 95% confident that the proportion of all college-educated adults to answer this question correctly is between 12.2% and 35.8%

Since the null value (0.333) falls within the range of plausible value from the confidence interval, we cannot say the null value is implausible.

> [!info] Compare the p-value to $\alpha$ to evaluate $H_0$
> When the p-value is less than the significance level, $\alpha$, reject $H_0$, and report that the data provide strong evidence supporting the alternative hypothesis.
When the p-value is greater than $\alpha$, do not reject $H_0$, and report that we do not have sufficient evidence to reject the null hypothesis.
