The formal name for a row is a **case** or **observational unit**. Columns represent **characteristics/variables** 

|            | Case 1 |
| ---------- | ------ |
| Variable 1 |        |
| Variable 2 |        |

Box Plot example

- The distance of an observation from its mean is its **deviation**
    - e.g. if the mean is 5 and the observation is 3, the deviation is 2
- The average of the square of deviations is called the **variance** and is denoted by $s^2$ or $\sigma^2$
- The **standard deviation** is the square root of the variance and is denoted by $s$ or $\sigma$
- Usually ~70% of data is within one standard deviation of the mean

- **Robust Statistics**
    - The median and IQR are called robust statistics because outliers have little influence on their values
    - Conversely, the mean and standard deviation are more heavily influenced by outliers
- When data is strongly skewed, we sometimes transform them so they are easier to model
    - Consider a histogram of the population of countries, with an x-axis scaling by 100 million.
        - Almost all data will be in the first bin, and this doesnâ€™t tell us much
        - We could instead take the $\log$ of the x-axis, allowing us to see much more information about the data
            - Other common transformations are the square root ($\sqrt{\text{original observation}}$) or inverse $\frac{1}{\text{original observation}}$
    - A **transformation** is a rescaling of data using a function
    - Common goals of transformation are
        - Seeing the data structure differently
        - Reducing skew
        - Assisting in modelling
        - Straightening a nonlinear relationship in a scatter plot

**Intensity maps** should be used for geographical data; these are maps that use colour to indicate the value of a variable. They are not very helpful for seeing precise values, but they are very helpful for identifying geographic trends.
