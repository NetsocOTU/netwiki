# Difference between one-way and two-way tables
A one-way table describes counts for each outcome in a single variable. A two-way table describes counts for combinations of outcomes for two variables. 
when we consider a two-way table, we often would like to know if the variables are related in any way; that is, are they dependent or independent?

# Computing expected counts in a two-way table
To identify the expected count for the $i^{th}$ row and $j^{th}$ column, compute
$$\text{Expected Count}_{\text{row }i, \text{col }j}=\frac{(\text{row } i \text{ total}) \times (\text{column } j \text{ total})}{\text{table total}}$$
# Chi-square test for two-way tables
Computed the same way as a one-way table. Compute (observed count - expected count)$^2$ / expected count for each cell and take the sum to find $X^2$.

## Degrees of freedom for two-way tables
$df =$ (number of rows minus 1) $\times$ (number of columns minus 1)
