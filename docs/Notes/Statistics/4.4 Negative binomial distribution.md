Geometric distributions describe the probability of observing the first success on the $n^{th}$ trial. The **************************************************************negative binomial distribution************************************************************** is more general, describing the probability of observing the $k^{th}$ success on the $n^{th}$ trial.

ðŸ’¡ **Is it negative binomial? Checklist**  
- Trials are independent
-   Each trial outcome can be classified as success or failure
-   The probability of success is the same for each trial
-   The last trial _****must****_ be a success


## Example

The probability of a success is 0.8. What is the probability that it takes 6 trials to get 4 successes?

These are the 10 ways that the 4th success could be achieved on the 6th trial. All of these have 2 failures and 4 successes, so the probability is the same: $0.2^2*0.8^4=0.016384$. Thus, the probability that the 6th trial contains the 4th success is $10 * 0.016384 = 0.16384$

We broke the problem into two parts:

1.  Find the probability of a single sequence
2.  Multiply it by the number of possible sequences

How can we easily find the number of possible sequences?

$$ \binom{n-1}{k-1}=\frac{(n-1)!}{(k-1)!((n-1)-(k-1))!}=\frac{(n-1)!}{(k-1)!(n-k)!} $$

This is the number of ways we can order $k - 1$ successes and $n - k$ failures in $n - 1$ trials.

ðŸ’¡ **Negative Binomial Distribution** 
The negative binomial distribution describes the probability of observing the $k^{th}$ success on the $n^{th}$ trial, where all trials are independent: $\large P(k^{th}\text{ success on }n^{th} \text{ trial}) = \binom{n-1}{k-1}p^k(1-p)^{n-k}$ where $p$ is the probability that an individual trial is a success.
