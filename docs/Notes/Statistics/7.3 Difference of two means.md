The point estimate of a difference is found by taking the difference in the sample means: 
$$\large \bar{x}_{esc} - \bar{x}_{control}$$
# Using the $t$-distribution for a difference in means
The $t$-distribution can be used for inference when working with the standardized difference of two means if
- *Independence, extended*: The data ase independent within and between the two groups, e.g. the data come from independent random samples or from a randomized experiment
- *Normality*: We check the outliers rules of thumb for each group separately. 
The standard error may be computed as
$$\large SE=\sqrt{\frac{\sigma^2_1}{n_1}+\frac{\sigma^2_2}{n_2}}$$
If statistical software isn't available, use the smaller of $n_1-1$ and $n_2-1$ for the degrees of freedom. 

As with one-sample cases, compute the standard error using the sample standard deviations rather than the population standard deviations.
