$\hat{p}$ inherently has some *standard error*, so when stating an estimate for a population proportion, it is best practice to provide a plausible range of values instead of just the point estimate. 

Using only a point estimate is like fishing with a spear - we can throw a spear where we saw a fish, but we will probability miss. A confidence interval, however, is like fishing with a net; it provides a range of plausible values where we are likely to find the population parameter. 

The sample proportion $\hat{p}$ is the most plausible value of the population proportion. the standard error provides a guide for how large we should make the confidence interval. 

When the Central Limit Theorem conditions are satisfied, the point estimate closely follows a normal distribution. In a normal distribution, 95% of data points are within 1.96 standard deviations of the mean. Using this principle, we can construct a confidence interval that extends 1.96 standard errors from the sample proportion to be 95% confident that the interval captures the population proportion. 

point estimate $\pm 1.96 \cdot SE$
$\hat{p} \pm 1.96 \cdot \sqrt{\frac{p(1-p)}{n}}$

"95% confident" means that if we took many samples and built a 95% confidence interval from each, about 95% of those intervals would contain the parameter, $p$.

> [!example] 5.8. A Pew research poll found that 88.7% of a random sample of 1000 Americans supported expanding the role of solar power. Compute and interpret a 95% confidence interval for he population proportion. The standard error is 0.010.

# Changing the Confidence Interval
If $X$ is a normally distributed random variable, what is the probability of the value $X$ being within 2.58 standad deviations of the mean?

This is equivalent to asking how often the Z-score $z$ will be $-2.58 < z < 2.58$. We can use statistical software, a calculator, or a table to look up these values for a normal distribution: 0.0049 and 0.9951. Thus, there is a $0.9951 - 0.0049 \approx 0.99$ probability that an unobserved normal random variable $X$ will be within 2.58 standard deviations of $\mu$. 

This means that 99% of the time, a normal random variable will be within 2.58 standard deviations of the mean. to create a 99% confidence interva, we change 1.96 in the 95% confidence interval formula to 2.58. Therefore:
> [!formula] Formula for 99% confidence interval
> $\text{point estimate } \pm 2.58 \cdot SE$

What about when our model does not fit the normal distribution?

> [!def] Confidence interval using any confidence level
> If a point estimate closely follows a normal model with standard error SE, then a confidence interval for the population parameter is 
> $\text{point estimate } \pm z^* \cdot SE$
> where $z^*$ corresponds to the confidence level selected. 


> [!def] Margin of error
> In a confidence interval, $z^* \cdot SE$ is called the margin of error.

# Interpreting Confidence Intervals
Confidence intervals are only about the population parameter. It says nothing about individual observations or point estimates.
