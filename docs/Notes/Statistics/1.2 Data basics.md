- Formal name for a row in a table is a **case** or **observational unit**
	- Columns represent characteristics, aka **variables**
- Data matrix is like a table/excel spreadsheet type thing
- **Types of variables**
	- Numerical
		- Continuous or Discrete
	- Categorical
		- Values are called the variable's **levels**
		- **Ordinal** variables have a natural order, i.e. 'education level' - high school below university, undergrad below postgrad, etc.
		- **Nominal** variables have no natural order - i.e. types of fruit
- When two variables show a connection with each other, they are said to be **associated** or **dependent**
- An **explanatory** variable has an affect on a **response** variable - i.e. study time affects grade results.

- An **observational study** is when you collect data in a way that does not directly interfere with how the data arises
	- **prospective study** identifies individuals and collects information as events unfold
	- **retrospective study** collects data after events have taken place


- **Simple random sample** - equivalent to using a raffle to select cases, all cases in population have an equal chance of being included
- **Non-response bias** is introduced when there is a high rate of non-response - certain groups may not be represented because they choose not to respond to surveys
- **Convenience sample** - picking the most easily accessible to be included in the sample

- Making causal conclusions based on observational data is not recommended - generally it only shows associations that can be used to form hypotheses. 
- A **confounding** variable is correlated to the explanatory and response variables
	- i.e. study shows that people who have higher use of sunscreen get skin cancer more often
	- the confounding variable is sun exposure time; people who are outside more are more likely to use sunscreen and get skin cancer

# Four sampling methods
- **Simple random sampling**
	- raffle; all cases in population are equally likely to be included
	- e.g. randomly choosing NBA players to compare salary
- **Stratified sampling**
	- population divided into groups called *strata*, chosen so that similar cases are grouped
	- second sampling method, usually simple random, is employed within each stratum
	- e.g. randomly picking 5 members of each NBA team to compare salary
- **Cluster sampling**
	- Break population into groups (*clusters*), then sample a fixed number of clusters and include all observations from each of those clusters in the sample
	- **multistage sample** is similar, but instead of keeping *all* observations from each cluster, we collect a random sample within each selected cluster
	- Useful when different clusters vary a lot, but within clusters there isn't much variation


# Experiments
Any study where the researchers assign treatments is an experiment. Randomized experiments generally follow four principles:
- **Controlling** - researchers control differences in groups. 
	- e.g. some people take pills with a small amount of water, others a large amount. Doctors may ask all patients to drink the same volume of water with the pill instead
- **Randomization** - randomize patients into treatment groups to account for variables that cannot be controlled
	- e.g. some patients may be more susceptible to a disease because of their diet; randomization helps even out these differences
- **Replication** - the more cases you observe, the more accurately you can estimate the effect of the explanatory variable on the response. Replicate the experiment until you collect a large enough sample. Additionally, studies can be replicated by others to verify their results
- **Blocking** - sometimes variables other than treatment influence the response. When this happens, group individuals based on this variable into *blocks*, then randomize cases within each block 
	- e.g. looking at the effect of a drug on heart attacks, we split the patients into low-risk and high-risk, then randomly assign half the patients from each block to the control group and the other half to the treatment group

- When a patient doesn't know whether they are in the treatment group or control group, the study is said to be **blind**
- A **double-blind** study is when the researcher also doesn't know which group is which - if they know, they can introduce bias
