# Introduction
This repository is intended to serve as a resource hub for the Networking and IT Security program at Ontario Tech University, providing study resources and general information related to each course.

Please note that some information may eventually become outdated. For instance, a course's textbook may change, or a course that originally didn't have an exam may have one added. If you notice such a discrepancy, you can either make your own commit and open a Pull Request, or open an issue to have one of the maintainers fix it.

## Academic Integrity Policy
All students are welcome to contribute. However, please note that you may not add any resources that violate the school's academic integrity guidelines - for instance, lecture slides, projects/assignments, quizzes/exams, or copyrighted textbooks. If you attempt to add material to the repository that violates this policy, you will be banned from contributing and potentially reported to the school. If you are unsure whether something violates the guidelines, please contact a maintainer directly.
